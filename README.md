<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Max Martin</h1>

<div>
  <p>
    I'm a Software Engineering student at the <strong>University of Florida</strong> graduating in May 2026,
    with hands-on experience building production backend and full-stack systems across large-scale,
    cloud-based environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've worked as a Software Engineering Intern at <strong>Oracle</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, and <strong>CACI</strong>,
    contributing to systems that prioritize performance, reliability, and scalability.
    My experience spans backend APIs, serverless architectures, distributed systems,
    and data pipelines operating at real-world scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    At <strong>Oracle</strong>, I work on the Aconex Connected Cost platform, engineering scalable enhancements
    and bug fixes using Angular, Java, and Node to improve production reliability across
    core workflows supporting thousands of active construction projects globally.
    I collaborate closely with distributed Agile teams, contribute production-ready code,
    and support releases through PR reviews, testing, and defect resolution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously at <strong>Amazon</strong>, I built a real-time volume forecast API using TypeScript,
    AWS Lambda, and S3 to replace legacy batch pipelines, improving data retrieval speed by 35%
    for over 22,000 users. I also developed SDKs and API documentation to drive adoption across
    multiple services and built extensive test automation to ensure reliable deployments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier in my career at <strong>CACI</strong>, I worked on systems supporting global satellite and
    antenna operations by building real-time dashboards, telemetry ingestion pipelines,
    and containerized backend services processing data for thousands of satellites
    and 150+ ground stations worldwide.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of internships, I’m the <strong>Lead Software Developer</strong> at
    <strong>Dream Team Engineering</strong>, where I lead internal platform development and built
    a recruitment system managing 200+ applications, streamlining selection workflows by 40%.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m especially interested in backend engineering, cloud infrastructure,
    and developer tooling, roles where I can own systems end-to-end and deliver
    software with real operational impact.
